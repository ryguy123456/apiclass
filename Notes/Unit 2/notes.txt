array methods

let words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door'];

let shortWords = words.filter(function(word) {
  return word.length < 6;
});

let shortWords = words.filter(word => word.length < 6);


let cities = ['Nashville', 'Charlotte', 'Asheville', 'Austin', 'Boulder'];

let nums = [1, 50, 75, 200, 350, 525, 1000];

//  Choose a method that will return undefined
cities.forEach(city => console.log('Have you visited ' + city + '?'));

// Choose a method that will return a new array
let longCities = cities.filter(city => city.length > 7);

// Choose a method that will return a new array
let smallerNums = nums.map(num => num - 5);

// Choose a method that will return a boolean value
nums.some(num => num < 0);

1.
Replace the word method in the first method call with a method that will do something to each of the values in the array and return undefined.
2.
In the second method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a new array with only those elements longer than 7 characters.
3.
In the third method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a new array of numbers returned from the function.
4.
In the fourth method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a boolean value.


Review: Iterators
You have learned a number of useful methods in this lesson as well as how to use the JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network to discover and understand additional methods. Let's review!

.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.
.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
All iterator methods can be written using arrow function syntax. In fact, given the succinctness and the implicit return of arrow function syntax, this is quickly becoming the preferred way to write these types of method calls.
You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).
Additional iterator methods such as .some(), .every(), .reduce() perform different functions.
